Notebook &amp; instructions to create a web user flow with plotly's sankey diagram

Much of this code can be attributed to Andreas Tsangarides - see original blog [here](https://medium.com/multiplyai/user-journey-sankey-diagram-25bb1aa42484). Additional features include adding page view times and differentiating between page views and click events.
